# Proof-of-concept for data protection using browser fingerprint


**A course project for COE 531 Advanced Software Engineering, Spring 2019, AUS**

This project is using [browser fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint) to track users, so that users have to use their online services in an authorized device, which would prevent the users from share their subscriptions with non-subscribed users.

------
This project is built based on a sophisticated [boilerplate](https://github.com/codeep/React-Express-Boilerplate) that uses React on front-end and Node.js (Express) on back-end.

This boilerplate is empowered by the following technologies:
• Redux  
• Redux-saga  
• Mongoose  
• Material-UI  
• Moment  

It's a usable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app, using todo-s to illustrate that.

Follow the steps below to get started using this boilerplate for your project!

### Prerequisites
• Node - version >= 7  
• npm - version >= 4  
• MongoDB - any version

## Install

First, clone the repository via git:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/forchain/user-fingerprint.git
```
Then, install dependencies using npm.
```bash
$ cd user-fingerprint
$ npm install
```
## Run

Start the app:
```bash

```
This command will start the React application and API simultaneously.
